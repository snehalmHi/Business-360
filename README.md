# Business Insights 360 - Power BI Project

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
This repository contains my first Power BI project, **Business Insights 360**, developed as part of the **Codebasics Data Analytics 2.0 Bootcamp**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Introduction
AtliQ Hardware faced significant challenges due to reliance on outdated Excel files for data insights. The lack of effective analytics led to major losses, particularly in Latin America.
